<h2>About</h2>

   <img id="photo" src="https://i.imgur.com/6QFERhe.png" alt="Me">
   <p class="me"> My name is Nick Morse. I used to call Vancouver Washington home until I decided to go out of my comfort zone and moved from my roots. I grew up playing all kinds of sports but basketball is where I found my true passion. I played for 12 years til I was sidelined with a knee injury. Even with that hiccup in my life I still have a passion for it. I am also a huge Portland Trail Blazer fan, since I grew up around that area I had to find a fanbase. I found myself going to many Blazer games, so much I could say that I have seen a total of 15 other NBA teams play at the Rose Garden. I would say I am very adventerous and am super eager to travel the world. I have only been out of cournty one time, and that time I flew to Australia and spent 10 amazing days there. I attended Eastern Washington Unviversity from 2017-2021 and I am glad to finally be graduated. I fell in love with marketing when I was a junior in high school and never looked back. I have a degree in marketing with minors in design and international business. I am excited to see what my future holds as me and my fiancee move forward with our lives. Life is a journy and I am ready for it.</p>
